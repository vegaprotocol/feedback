## Starting a discussion

Prior to opening a new discussion, please look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already raised your suggestions or reported the same bug. If you find a similar discussion has already been created, reply with additional details or upvote the discussion to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

Please review the [CONTRIBUTOR COVENANT CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/feedback/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.
